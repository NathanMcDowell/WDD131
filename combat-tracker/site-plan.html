			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>List of damage types. There isn't much in terms of content for the main page. It will be mostly user input and interaction.</p>
			<h3>Combat Information Page</h3>
			<p>
				Being Prone
				Combatants often find themselves Iying on the ground,
either because they are knocked down ar because they
thraw themselves down. In the game, they are prane,
a condition described in appendix A.
Vou can drop prone without using any of your
speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For •.•
example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet
of movement to stand up. Vou can't stand up if you don't
have enough movement left or if your speed is O.
To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic
such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while
crawling costs 1 extra fool. Crawling 1 foot in difficult
terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.
			</p>
			<p> Moving Around Other Creatures
				You can move through a nonhostile creature's space.
In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's
space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or
smaller than you. Remember that another creature's
space is difficult terrain for you.
Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't
willingly end your move in its space.
If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your
move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained
later in the chapter.</p>
			<p>Grappling
				When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it,
you can use the Attack action to make a special melee
attack, a grapple. If you're able to make multiple attacks
with the Atlack action, this atlack replaces one of them.
The target of your grapple must be no more than one
size larger than you, and it must be within your reach.
Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target
by making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics)
check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the
ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to
the grappled condition (see appendix A). The condition
specifies the things that end it, and you can release the
target whenever you like (no action required).
Escaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its
action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by
your Strength (Athletics) check.
Moving a Grappled Creature. When you move, you
can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but
your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more
sizes smaller than you.
			</p>
			<p>Shoving A Creature
				Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee
atlack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or
push it away from you. Ifyou're able to make multiple
atlacks with the Attack action, this atlack replaces
one ofthem.
The target of your shove must bc no more than one
size larger than you, and it must be within your reach.
Vou make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the
target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win
the contest, you either knock the target prone or push
it 5 feet away from you.
			</p>
			<p>Cover
				Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide
cover during combat, making a target more difficult
to harm. A target can benetit from cover only when an
attack or other effect originates on the opposite side
of the cover.
There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind
multi pIe sources of cover, only the most protective
degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added
together. For example, if a target is behind a creature
that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives threequarters
cover, the target has three-quarters cover.
A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and
Oexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an
obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle
might be a low wall. a large piece of furniture, a narrow
tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an
enemy or a friend.
A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus
to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three quarters
cover if about three-quarters of it is covered
by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an
arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.
A target with total cover can't be targeted directly
by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach
such a target by including it in an area of effect. A
target has total cover if it is completely concealed by
an obstacle.
			</p>
			<p>Knocking A Creature Out
				Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe,
rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker
reduces a creature to Ohit points with a melee attack,
the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker
can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt.
The creature falls unconscious and is stable.
