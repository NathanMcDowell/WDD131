        <h2 id="being-prone">Being Prone</h2>
        <p>Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either 
            because they are knocked down or because they throw 
            themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition 
            described in appendix A. You can drop prone without using 
            any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so 
            costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For 
            example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of 
            movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have 
            enough movement left or if your speed is 0. To move while 
            prone, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation. 
            Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. 
            Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 
            feet of movement.
        </p>
        <h2 id="moving-around-other-creatures">Moving Around Other Creatures</h2>
        <p>You can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In 
            contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space 
            only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller 
            than you. Remember that another creature's space is 
            difficult terrain for you. Whether a creature is a friend or 
            an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space. If 
            you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you 
            provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the 
            chapter.
        </p>
        <h2 id="grappling">Grappling</h2>
        <p>When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can 
            use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a 
            grapple. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the 
            Attack action, this attack replaces one of them. The target 
            of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than 
            you, and it must be within your reach. Using at least one 
            free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple 
            check, a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the 
            target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) 
            check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you 
            succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition 
            (see appendix A). The condition specifies the things that 
            end it, and you can release the target whenever you like 
            (no action required). Escaping a Grapple. A grappled 
            creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must 
            succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) 
            check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check. Moving 
            a Grappled Creature. When you move, you can drag or carry 
            the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, 
            unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.
        </p>
        <h2 id="shoving-a-creature">Shoving A Creature</h2>
        <p>Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack 
            to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it 
            away from you. If you're able to make multiple attacks with 
            the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them. The 
            target of your shove must be no more than one size larger 
            than you, and it must be within your reach. Vou make a 
            Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's 
            Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the 
            target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, 
            you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away 
            from you.
        </p>
        <h2 id="cover">Cover</h2>
        <p>Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide 
            cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. 
            A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other 
            effect originates on the opposite side of the cover. There 
            are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple 
            sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover 
            applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, 
            if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and 
            a tree trunk that gives threequarters cover, the target has 
            three-quarters cover. A target with half cover has a +2 bonus 
            to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover 
            if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle 
            might be a low wall. a large piece of furniture, a narrow 
            tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy 
            or a friend. A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 
            bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three 
            quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by 
            an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow 
            slit, or a thick tree trunk. A target with total cover can't 
            be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some 
            spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of 
            effect. A target has total cover if it is completely 
            concealed by an obstacle.
        </p>
        <h2 id="knocking-a-creature-out">Knocking A Creature Out</h2>
        <p>A Creature Out Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a 
            foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker 
            reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the 
            attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make 
            this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature 
            falls unconscious and is stable.</p>
